What is phishing?

The advancement of technology comes with repercussions. As machines become smarter, the dark side also learns new ways to try to interfere. One way that this is happening is through phishing. Most people have come across phishing attempts whether they know it or not. So, what is it? Phishing is a method of obtaining sensitive information of others through emails or other forms of electronic communication. This includes usernames, passwords, credit card information, and even social security numbers. Phishing allows hackers to access various accounts and private information which can be very damaging. 

How to recognize phishing?

The main purpose of phishing is its intention to appear realistic. Therefore, phishers thoroughly attempt to make it seem as normal as possible, making it hard to recognize that it is a scam. Usually they will resemble a familiar company that you would know and trust. It could come in the form of a bank, a social media site, an online store, etc. Make sure to pay close attention to details of emails that are asking for sensitive information -- if anything looks off, it is better to be safe than sorry!
