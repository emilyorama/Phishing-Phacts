        All films have a structure; whether it be the "Three Act Structure" or an experimental choice by the writer. <br>
        However, many screenplay writers choose to follow the Three Act Structure. Why? <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The structure has three "acts" that serve as the different parts of the film:
        <ol>
            <li>Act One: Setup</li>
            <li>Act Two: Confrontation</li>
            <li>Act Three: Resolution</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3><em>Act One</em></h3>
        <p>
        Act One serves as an introduction to the film. All main charatcers are introduced and the universe and setting in which the story takes place is explained. However one of the most important aspects of Act One is the disruption of the status quo; the change in the norm. The protagonist faces a challange or conflict in which their life has changed in some way, creating the basis of the story. The change is identified and the protagonist begins to encounter resulting conflicts. 
        </p>
        
        <h3><em>Act Two</em></h3>
        <p>
        Act Two contains most of the storyline, and is usually half of the entire film time. In this act, the protagonist confronts his or her conflicts in which they attempt to overpower or control. The stakes of their actions are increasing, making their choices more difficult. They encounter continuous obstacles, leading to the end of the act where they usually face a downfall. Towards the end of Act Two, the idea that "all is lost" is introduced. The protagonist has been defeated or felt as if there is no hope for a better outcome.
        </p>
        
        <h3><em>Act Three</em></h3>
        <p>Act Three portrays the resolution to the challenge or conflict. The beginning of the act includes part of the climax, in which the protagonist discovers a way to overcome the conflict, or has regained the hope in order to solve it. This act is essentially the <em>denouement</em> of the film, meaning all matters and conflicts are resolved with a satisfying ending.

        <img src="images/threeact1.png" width="400" alt= "A visual depiction of the Three Act Structure on a graph. Shape of graph resembles inverted check mark, with Act One at bottom, preceding upwards to Act Three">
        
        <p><em>As you can see, the Three Act Structure begins at the bottom point, and moves up through the acts throughout the movie until the denouement in Act Three, where it goes back down. </em></p>
        
        <h3><em>The Effect</em></h3>
        <p>This structure is very popular amongst filmmakers because it is familiar to viewers, and is most accepted by viewers. A perfect example of this structure is the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. These films are huge hits in the box office not only because the franchise is so popular, but because these films follow the satisfying storyline of the Three Act Structure. Viewers will not know everything that will ensue in the film, but they have reassurance that the hero protagonist will always overcome the antagonist. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        WARNING: the following example contains spoilers <br>
        <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em> (2017), for example, follows the Three Act Structure, and made millions in the box office during its debut.<br>
        Act One introduces the Marvel universe and the protagonist Peter Parker. Since the film is sort of a continuation of the other Marvel film <em>Civil War</em>, Peter has already been given his superpowers before the start of this movie, therefore the break of the status quo is not the usual "new found powers" idea. However, Peter Parker returns to home and now has a brand new Spider-Man suit, where he must conceal his superhero identity. Peter continues to only do friendly neighborhood acts rather than fighting major criminals. The status quo is broken when Peter encounters a group of robbers, where they use earthly-foreign weapons against him.  <br>
        In Act Two, Peter Parker begins to investiagte where these weapons came from and who is producing them. His obstacles include: not being listened to by his authorities (Tony Stark) when he tries to warn them, being on his own against criminals with advanced technologies, concealing his identity from his classmates and aunt, and balancing school with his investigation. Peter becomes aware of the main antagonist, the Vulture, in which he must defeat. The "all is lost" point becomes evident when Tony Stark confiscates his spider-suit after almost sinking a ferry. The question remains: how will Peter defeat the Vulture without his suit? <br>
        The climax and resolution of the film is the final battle with the Vulture, and of course, Peter Parker winning the battle. Tony Stark aplogizes for not taking his concerns seriously, and offers him a new suit and a spot in the Avengers team. Peter makes friends, none of his friends are hurt, and he wins the battle. 
        </p>
        
        <p>A film such as this follows the Three Act Structure, and satisfies the viewer while following the structure they expected to see. This is one of the main reasons why movies like this have such high box office numebers. These films follow the same template that Marvel movies continue to use. This does not imply that this repetitive use should be changed; viewers come to see these movies expecting this structure, but it does not take away the suspense and intriguing action of the film.

        Gary Kurtz, producer of the Star Wars series, explains the Three Act Structure in simpler terms:
        <blockquote> <!-- Indentation on the page to emphasize the quote being used -->
            “I took a master class with Billy Wilder once and he said that in the first act of a story you put your character up in a tree and the second act you set the tree on fire and then in the third you get him down.”
        </blockquote>
